                    breadth of its offerings. With the recent lifting of most restrictions, EDITION’s new Tokyo location
                    is now fully operational and ready to serve guests at full capacity.</p>
                <p class="description">Defined as a “true bespoke, custom-made hotel embodying the best of the East and
                    the best of the West,” the EDITION hotel was designed in partnership with renowned architect Kengo
                    Kuma to offer the essence and spirit of Tokyo all within the confines of the premises.</p>
