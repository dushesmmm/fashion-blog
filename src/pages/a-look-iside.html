    <h1 class="main__text first">While The Tokyo EDITION, Toranomon first opened in October of 2020, it wasn’t until
        recently that international guests were able to visit the location and experience the full breadth of its
        offerings. With the recent lifting of most restrictions, EDITION’s new Tokyo location is now fully operational
        and ready to serve guests at full capacity.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">Defined as a “true bespoke, custom-made hotel embodying the best of the East and the best of
        the West,” the EDITION hotel was designed in partnership with renowned architect Kengo Kuma to offer the essence
        and spirit of Tokyo all within the confines of the premises. Leading the project is EDITION brand creator Ian
        Schrager, who’s known for magical moments such as producing the first American fashion show for the late
        designer Issey Miyake and enlisting architect Arata Isozaki to design the infamous Palladium Nightclub in NYC.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">“Nothing makes me more excited than seeing the EDITION Hotel open in Tokyo, a favorite
        destination of mine and the place I was born. In partnership with Mori Trust and my friend Ian Schrager, The
        Tokyo EDITION, Toranomon is a beacon of hope and optimism for the future, a place where thousands of travelers
        and local customers will be welcomed in the years ahead. Particularly in this time of complexity, the opening of
        The Tokyo EDITION, Toranomon stands as proof that we will return – to travel, to togetherness and to joy,” says
        Marriot International CEO Arne Sorenson.</h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">The 206-room hotel is housed within a new 38-story skyscraper known as Tokyo World Gate,
        where it occupies floors between 31 to 36, offering unobstructed views of the Tokyo skyline and a
        picture-perfect look at the landmark Tokyo Tower. Inspired by Buddhist temples and their organization, spaces
        were created to encourage communal and social interaction in all forms. Numerous experiences, which all offer
        their own individual reality yet at the same time can be enjoyed all in one day, radiate from the Lobby in the
        way peripheral buildings do in a temple.</h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">Food and beverage options are led by award-winning Michelin-star chef Tom Aikens who’s known
        for his ability to execute different international cuisines in an inventive way. Options begin with the BLUE
        ROOM, a glamorous and romantic all-day dining venue with upholstery reminiscent of a Yves Klein painting and an
        atmosphere that hearkens back to the glamour of old Hollywood. On the same floor, JADE ROOM offers an original
        bespoke menu giving a sense of the local flavors of Japan. Outside, guests will find a garden terrace home to
        over 500 plant species.</h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">For drinks, the GOLD BAR AT EDITION located on the ground floor seamlessly transforms from a
        relaxed lounge during the day to a sophisticated cocktail bar at night. The design features touches of white and
        gold with blackened wood finishes inspired by Japanese yakisugi and white barrel-vaulted, 16ft-high ceilings.
        Rounding out the portfolio is a scenic LOBBY BAR at the heart of the hotel serving a range of custom cocktails
        and an “infinite” variety of sake.</h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">All rooms offer unobstructed views of Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Bay, featuring a relaxing “no
        color” palette of treated white oak and light gray, ivory, and silver. Amenities include a tranquil spa, 24-hour
        gym powered by Technogym, swimming pool, four meeting studios, and a 250-person capacity ballroom.</h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">“We wanted to do something that embodies the traditions of Japan, but also looks forward with
        design and visuals and brings a sense of the cutting edge and avant-garde, which Tokyo always does as well.
        We’ve created this energized resort in the middle of Tokyo, a beehive of activity where you can get away without
        ever leaving,” summarizes Schrager.</h1>
    <h1 class="main__text">The Tokyo EDITION, Toranomon is now <a href="https://www.editionhotels.com/tokyo-toranomon"
            class="side__link">open</a>. Take a closer look above.</h1>
